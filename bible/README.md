Most scholars think Matthew used the Gospel of Mark and the Q source (shared with the Gospel of Luke),[14][15] though alternative hypotheses that posit use of Matthew by Luke or vice versa without Q are increasing in popularity.[16][17] 


# Mark

The four canonical gospels are anonymous and most researchers agree that none of them was written by eyewitnesses,[45][46][47][48] though that would not preclude the theory that Mark's gospel was based on Peter's eyewitness testimony.

The Gospel of Mark was written in Greek, for a gentile audience, and probably in Rome, although Galilee, Antioch (third-largest city in the Roman Empire, located in northern Syria), and southern Syria have also been suggested.[11][43] 


The earliest extant Greek manuscripts of Mark, codices Vaticanus (which contains a large blank space in the column after 16:8) and Sinaiticus, end at Mark 16:8, with the women fleeing in fear from the empty tomb. The majority of recent scholars believe this to be the original ending,[19]

According to textual critic Fenton Hort, Sinaiticus and Vaticanus were derived from a much older common source, "the date of which cannot be later than the early part of the second century, and may well be yet earlier".[26]

TODO

populate a database with the book, chapter, verse, text with capitalization and punctuation, and with all lowercase and punctuation removed.


Then sort by punctuation removed and see where Mark and Matthew are direct 1:1 copies.

There are a couple greek sources used in some of the early greek to latin translations. Jerome brought about the definitive latin edition for the catholic church that most others are based on which a Nova Vlugata in 1960's?

I'm interested in the one as close to Jerome as possible. He does include the long Mark 16 chapter.
