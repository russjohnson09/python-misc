Most scholars think Matthew used the Gospel of Mark and the Q source (shared with the Gospel of Luke),[14][15] though alternative hypotheses that posit use of Matthew by Luke or vice versa without Q are increasing in popularity.[16][17] 


# Mark

The four canonical gospels are anonymous and most researchers agree that none of them was written by eyewitnesses,[45][46][47][48] though that would not preclude the theory that Mark's gospel was based on Peter's eyewitness testimony.

The Gospel of Mark was written in Greek, for a gentile audience, and probably in Rome, although Galilee, Antioch (third-largest city in the Roman Empire, located in northern Syria), and southern Syria have also been suggested.[11][43] 


The earliest extant Greek manuscripts of Mark, codices Vaticanus (which contains a large blank space in the column after 16:8) and Sinaiticus, end at Mark 16:8, with the women fleeing in fear from the empty tomb. The majority of recent scholars believe this to be the original ending,[19]

According to textual critic Fenton Hort, Sinaiticus and Vaticanus were derived from a much older common source, "the date of which cannot be later than the early part of the second century, and may well be yet earlier".[26]
