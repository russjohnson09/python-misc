Jerome also is cited as a witness against the Long Ending. However, when Jerome produced the Vulgate Gospels (A.D. 383/384), he included the Long Ending. And his Epistle 120 (Ad Hedibiam), which is the basis for the claim that manuscripts known to Jerome lacked the Long Ending, is an edited translation of Eusebius' Ad Marinum (even some of the questions are the same); it is not an independent assessment of the manuscript-evidence. Furthermore, in Against the Pelagians 2:15, where Jerome quotes an interpolation (the "Freer Logion"), he locates it as occurring after the text of Mark 16:14, and states that the interpolation is present "in some copies, especially Greek codices," which means that verses 9-20 were in those copies also.
